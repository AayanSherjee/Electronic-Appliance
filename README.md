# Electronic-Appliance
Wrote this code for a quiz in my university.
<br/>
Following was the scenario:
<br/>
A software for a smart home system to control various appliances like lights, fans, and thermostats.
Each appliance can perform multiple actions, such as turning on/off or adjusting specific settings (like brightness for lights, speed for fans, and temperature for thermostats).
The system should allow the user to first select which appliance they want to control and then choose the desired action.
<br/>
The user should first select the appliance (1 for Light, 2 for Fan, 3 for Thermostat), and then choose the action to perform for that appliance.
The program should ask for any additional input necessary (e.g., brightness level for light, speed for fan, or temperature for the thermostat)
<br/>
For the above given scenario reproduce a  C++ program that have following functionality:
<br/>
1.	Based on user input, allows the user to select an appliance and perform the corresponding action.
2.	Handles invalid input and offers multiple control options.
